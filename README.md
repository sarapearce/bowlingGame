# Bowling Game

This project is a bowling game written in Python/Flask, Docker, and React. It was written with a very lean production environment in mind.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/testdrivenio/testdriven-app-2.3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/testdrivenio/testdriven-app-2.3)

## Getting Started

Clone this repo: https://github.com/sarapearce/bowling-game

Most changes will be made in the users directory.

To play the game:

`cd bowling-game`

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d --build`

These two commands will spin up the Docker containers and the servers within. You should be able to see the front-end at http://localhost

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

See the Dockerfile inside each of the services directories for a list of dependencies.

Major Prerequisites are:
Python 3.7.1
React 17.1
Docker
Nginx

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
